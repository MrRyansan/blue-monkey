        <h3>The Reason For This Site</h3>
        <p>
          Japan, Japanese culture, and the language have become a really big part of my life. In wanting to learn the language, I came 
          across WaniKani and it has become pivotal in my studies. I wanted to create apps that can accentuate what WaniKani offers in order
          to assist with my learning and also offer something to the community that they can use and hopefully find helpful as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are things you wish you could do with WaniKani to help you on your journey, and you think it could also benefit others, please
          feel free to contact me on the <b><a href="contact.html">contact page</a></b>. I'd love to hear your ideas.
        </p>    
        <h3>The Name</h3>
        <p>
          I tried to come up with a clever "two animal mash up" like WaniKani and KameSame, but was having a hard time finding two
          animal names that rhymed in Japanese. I like monkeys so was trying to find something that rhymed with "saru" and couldn't,
          so I then thought maybe "saru saru"? But, then that's not a mashup, and I didn't know how I'd represent them as a character 
          (a two headed monkey seemed a bit creepy).
          I then started looking for maybe colors that rhymed with "saru", and saw blue... but "aoi saru" didn't work either, so I just went with "Blue Monkey" 
          and there you have it.
        </p>
