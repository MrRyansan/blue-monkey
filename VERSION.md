- Gives you several options for the organization of the sentences:
  - Font size.
  - Number of sentences per paragraph.
  - How many sentences per vocab word to include (since there are usually multiple sentences for each word).
  - What vocab levels to include (only goes as high as your current level).
  - Whether to highlight the words so you can see which words in the sentence are vocab.
  - When words are highlighted (if you chose the previous option) clicking them will give you a pop up with things like level, sentence translation, meaning, reading, etc.
